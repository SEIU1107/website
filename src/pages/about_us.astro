        SEIU Local 1107 is the largest healthcare and public service union in
        Nevada, representing nearly 20,000 workers. We're a member-driven
        organization united by our mission to fight for good union jobs, quality
        services, and a better quality of life for all working Nevadans.
      </p>
      <p class="py-1">
        SEIU 1107 members care for hospital patients, protect water quality,
        assist low-income families, help operate Harry Reid International
        Airport, support the tourism economy, protect our most vulnerable
        community members, maintain streets and parks, work with foster
        children, and provide many other critical services. <b
          >In short, we keep Nevada running!</b
        >
      </p>
      <p class="py-1">
        Together, we hold both employers and elected leaders accountable to lift
        Nevadans out of poverty, ensure quality healthcare for all, advance
        pro-worker policies, and reduce inequality. For example, 1107 healthcare
        workers recently negotiated 13.75% raises over three years, and SEIU
        members statewide played a central role in raising the minimum wage for
        all home care workers in our state to $16 an hour.

          SEIU is building a 21st-century union to ensure that workers — not
          just corporations, and CEOs — benefit from our global economy. SEIU is
          working with unions in similar industries around the world to advocate
          strongly for fair wages and benefits and allow workers in every
          country the freedom to unionize.

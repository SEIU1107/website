          The 2024 Communities United Festival holds significance as Nevada is a
          crucial battleground state in the upcoming election. The event aims to
          mobilize voters - in particular union members, youth, and communities
          of color - through voter registration and education initiatives.
          Attendees will have the opportunity to engage with various
          organizations dedicated to encouraging unprecedented voter
          participation in this pivotal election.
        </p>
        <p class="py-2">
          "This festival is about more than just celebrating our diverse
          cultures; it's about harnessing our collective power to make a
          difference," said Michelle Maese, President of SEIU Local 1107.
          "Communities United aims to inspire and mobilize our community to take
          action. We anticipate our biggest turnout ever this year, as the
          enthusiasm and support from past years continue to grow. Don't miss
          your chance to be part of this year's festivities!"

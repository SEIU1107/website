                The Right to Request Representation During an Investigatory
                Interview
            </h2>
            <p class={paragraphClass}>
                Section 7 of the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) protects
                employees' right to "self-organization, to form, join, or assist
                labor organizations, to bargain collectively through
                representatives of their own choosing, and to engage in other
                concerted activities for the purpose of collective bargaining or
                other mutual aid and protection"
            </p>
            <p class={paragraphClass}>
                Among the rights protected by Section 7 is the right of
                union-represented employees, upon request, to have their
                representative present during an interview that the employee
                reasonably believes could lead to discipline. This right was
                first articulated by the Supreme Court in the case, NLRB v. J.
                Weingarten, Inc. In that case, the Court found that Section 7 of
                the NLRA protects employees who refuse to submit to certain
                interviews without a requested representative present.
            </p>
            <p class={paragraphClass}>
                An employee's requested representative, which may be a union
                steward, business agent or officer, or fellow employee, is often
                referred to as a “Weingarten representative.” Weingarten
                representatives are entitled to provide advice and active
                assistance to employees during investigatory interviews.
                Employees' right to request their representatives are frequently
                referred to as “Weingarten rights.”
            </p>
            <p class={paragraphClass}>
                Employers violate the NLRA if they proceed with an investigatory
                interview while refusing an employee's request or retaliate
                against them for making the request. Depending on the
                circumstances of each case, the Board may order that the
                employer cease and desist, post a remedial notice, require the
                employer to repeat the interview with a union member present, or
                rescind and remedy discipline resulting from a Weingarten
                violation.

                When do employees have a right to request a union
                representative?
            </h2>
            <p class={paragraphClass}>
                An employee's right to request a representative arises during an
                investigatory interview. A useful comparison is an individual's
                Miranda right to an attorney when questioned by law enforcement.
                However, unlike the right to counsel in a Miranda setting,
                employers are not required to inform union members of their
                rights under Weingarten.
            </p>
            <p class="pt-2">
                Any meeting may be an “investigatory interview” provided that
                the following occurs:
            </p>
            <ul class={ulClass}>
                <li>
                    A manager, representative of management, or supervisor is
                    seeking to question an employee.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The questioning is part of an investigation into the
                    employee's performance or work conduct. During an
                    investigatory interview, a representative of management may
                    require an employee to defend, explain, or admit misconduct
                    or work performance issues that may form the basis for
                    discipline or discharge.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The employee reasonably believes that the investigation may
                    result in discharge, discipline, demotion, or other adverse
                    consequence to their job status or working conditions.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The employee requests a union representative. Employers are
                    not required to advise employees of their right to
                    representation and third parties (including union
                    representatives) may not make the request on behalf of the
                    employee.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p class={paragraphClass}>
                When making a request for a representative, the Board does not
                require that the employee specify that they need a “Weingarten”
                representative. Once an employee requests their representative,
                they are not required to repeat that request.
            </p>

            <p class={paragraphClass}>
                At times, it is not clear whether a meeting is investigatory or
                could lead to discipline. In those cases, the National Labor
                Relations Board (NLRB) looks to the conduct of the meeting and
                the surrounding circumstances to determine if there was an
                investigatory purpose. The Board will consider such factors as
                the identity/status of the participants, the parties'
                collective-bargaining agreement and disciplinary practices,
                whether there was a confrontational tone to the meeting, any
                notices or warnings issued prior to the meeting, or whether
                employees had been disciplined for similar misconduct.

            <h2 class={subtitleClass} id="NOT_COVERED">
                What types of meetings are not covered by the Weingarten rule?
            </h2>
            <p class={paragraphClass}>
                If the above conditions are met, any meeting between an employer
                and employee could trigger an employee's Weingarten rights.
                However, not every meeting or employer questioning satisfies
                those conditions. For example, employers need not grant an
                employee's request for a representative in the following
                situations:
            </p>
            <ul class={ulClass}>
                <li>
                    Instructional meetings where an employee receives training
                    or correction on work techniques. Meetings of this nature
                    generally do not lead to discipline.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Meetings in which an employer informs an employee (or
                    employees) of personnel policies. Often these meetings do
                    not require questioning of employees and do not lead to
                    discipline.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Meetings in which the employee is informed in advance that
                    no discipline or adverse employment action will result from
                    the interview.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Meetings about disciplinary decisions that have already been
                    made. If an employer has made a final decision on a
                    disciplinary action, a meeting with an employee to inform
                    them of that decision is not considered investigatory. In
                    the same vein, if an employee initiates a meeting to discuss
                    a disciplinary action that they have experienced, that
                    meeting is not investigatory in nature because any
                    discipline that the employee has experienced has already
                    occurred.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Meetings in which an employee is questioned as part of an
                    investigation of another employee's conduct or performance.
                    For example, an employee who witnesses another employee's
                    misconduct is not entitled to Weingarten representation if
                    they are questioned about what they observed.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p class={paragraphClass}>
                Even in the above examples, however, the nature of a meeting may
                change as it progresses. If an employee reasonably believes that
                a meeting that commenced for some other purpose has become an
                investigatory interview, the Board will look to the above
                factors to determine if an employee's request for a
                representative should have been honored.

                Who may serve as an employee Weingarten representative?
            </h2>
            <p class={paragraphClass}>
                An employee may choose their own representative, who may be a
                representative of the union or a fellow employee. Employers are
                required to honor that request, so long as that choice does not
                unduly interfere with the employer's ability to conduct its
                investigation. Employees may not request a non-employee
                representative unless that individual is an officer or business
                agent of the employee's union. For example, an employee may not
                request a private attorney or a family member as their
                Weingarten representative if that individual has no affiliation
                with the employee's union.

            <p class={paragraphClass}>
                When an employee requests a representative during an
                investigatory interview, an employer may lawfully take one of
                three courses of action:
            </p>
            <ul class={ulClass}>
                <li>
                    The employer may grant the employee's request and delay the
                    interview until a representative is available.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The employer may deny the request and immediately end the
                    interview, or
                </li>
                <li>
                    The employer may allow the employee to choose whether to
                    proceed with the meeting without a representative or to end
                    the interview.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p class={paragraphClass}>
                If the employer denies the request and continues to ask
                questions, this could constitute an unfair labor practice. Also,
                it is an unfair labor practice for an employer to discipline an
                employee for refusing to answer questions without their union
                representative present.

                Union representatives serve as advisors and witnesses during
                employee interviews. Employers are required to inform union
                representatives as to the subject matter of the interview and
                allow time for that representative to meet with the employee
                prior to questioning.
            </p>
            <p class={paragraphClass}>
                During the interview, a union representative may ask the

                to answer questions (within limits), and provide additional
                information to the employer after the questioning. A union
                representative may also object to questions if they are
                badgering, intimidating, or offensive.

                When representing an employee during an investigatory interview,

            When workers stand together, the direction of our lives changes
            dramatically for the better. From wages to paid leave, from safety
            to retirement, studies prove over and over how much of a difference
            unions make for workers who raise their voices as one.
            <br />
            <br />
            The key difference is that when workers have a union, we are able to
            share decision making power with our employer and are able to negotiate
            a contract that spells out all our wages, benefits and working conditions.
            But without a union, the employer maintains all the power and we have
            little say in our jobs.

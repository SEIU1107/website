        Title: "Better Working Conditions",
        body: "Working together, union members have the strength to win better wages, affordable health care, a secure retirement, and safer workplaces. The “union advantage” is substantial. According to the U.S. Department of Labor, union members are much more likely to have health benefits and pensions.",

        Title: "Together, We Have a Voice",
        body: "Joining a union will give you a voice in your workplace. Without representation, the employer can change wages, benefits and work conditions without listening to the workers. Forming a union will ensure that workers have the power to bargain for a fair contract and the strength to protect that contract.",

        body: "For people of color and women workers, the union impact is even greater. Women workers who are union members earn nearly $9,000 a year more than their non-union counterparts. For African-American workers, the union differential is also about $9,000, and for Latino workers the yearly advantage is more than $11,000.",

        Title: "Protect Working Families",
        body: "In addition to helping workers win better wages and benefits, unions help all workers by giving working families a stronger voice in our communities, in the political arena, and in the global economy. By joining together, we can build the strength to hold elected officials accountable, stop the “race to the bottom” by employers who cut wages and benefits in favor of bigger profits, and win improvements such as affordable, quality health care for all.",

            When workers stand together, the direction of our lives changes
            dramatically for the better. From wages to paid leave, from safety
            to retirement, studies prove over and over how much of a difference
            unions make for workers who raise their voices as one.
            <br />
            <br />
             The key difference is that when workers have a union, we are able
            to share decision making power with our employer and are able to
            negotiate a contract that spells out all our wages, benefits and
            working conditions. But without a union, the employer maintains all
            the power and we have little say in our jobs.

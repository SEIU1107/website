On April 20th, 70 SEIU 1107 members made the trip up to Nevada's capital, Carson City, to visit the state legislature. Members joined their elected Assemblymembers and Senators on the Chamber floors and were recognized by the Legislature.

After the floor session, members began their meetings with Assemblymembers and Senators at their offices to advocate for our priorities. Members spoke passionately about the need to raise wages for home care workers, increase funding for home care, make Juneteenth a paid state holiday, and other bills that support working Nevadans.

In addition to meeting legislators, members took part in a tour of the Stewart Indian School. This tour educated members on the dark, sad, and untold history of forced assimilation for Native Americans in the United States. SEIU 1107 is a proudly anti-racist organization and believes this experience will further our racial justice work

SEIU's 2023 Lobby Day was a major success and legislators now, more than ever, understand the power and priorities of our union, our workplaces, and our communities. Get involved early and often with our upcoming political events throughout the year. We will continue to build on the success of Lobby Day as we move closer to the 2024 elections.

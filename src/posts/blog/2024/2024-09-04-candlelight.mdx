On September 4, 2024, SEIU 1107 Healthcare workers, gathered at Dignity Health St. Rose Dominican Hospital's Siena Campus in Henderson, Nevada, to protest alarming staffing cuts that threaten patient care and worker conditions. 

This demonstration comes amid a severe nationwide shortage of healthcare professionals and highlights the urgent need for responsible management practices in our local hospitals.

Our members, including Melinda Sauby, an emergency room technician at the Rose de Lima campus, voiced their deep concerns about the proposed job cuts. 

Sauby emphasized that reducing staff would exacerbate the existing shortage of healthcare workers in Nevada, placing even greater strain on an already overwhelmed workforce. 

“Our patient load is already heavy,” Sauby said. “The nurses are pushed to the limits. They don’t get to take a bathroom break. They don’t get to eat.”

The candlelight service was a poignant tribute to the lives at risk from what we view as reckless staffing reductions. Members and supporters held signs and shared their stories, bringing attention to the critical impact these cuts could have on patient care and worker wellbeing.

In response to the protest, Dignity Health issued a statement explaining their decision to reduce the workforce by less than 2 percent across the three affected hospitals—Rose de Lima, Siena, and San Martin. Gordon Absher, a communications manager for Dignity Health,  saif that these cuts are a measure to manage rising costs and increased insurance denial rates. Dignity Health emphasized their commitment to managing resources wisely while continuing to deliver high-quality care.
However, our union believes that cutting jobs during a healthcare worker shortage is counterproductive and harmful.

District 8 Assemblyman Duy Nguyen, who attended the vigil, supported our stance, urging Dignity Health to reconsider. “Sometimes they see their patients more than they see their own family members,” Nguyen said, referring to the healthcare workers who often work overtime to fill vacancies. 

“We as a state need to create a work environment where our healthcare workers feel like they're part of the critical workforce that’s needed.”
We must stand united to protect our healthcare workers and ensure they have the support and resources they need to provide the best possible care to our community. 

As we move forward, SEIU 1107 remains committed to advocating for fair treatment of healthcare workers and fighting against cuts that jeopardize patient care. Stay tuned for updates and ways you can support our efforts.

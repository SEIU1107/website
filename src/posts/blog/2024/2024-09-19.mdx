SEIU Local 1107 - the largest union of healthcare and public service workers in Nevada - is ramping up its massive voter outreach program this weekend, coinciding with its third annual Communities United Multicultural Festival, bringing Nevadans together to celebrate our diversity and shared values.

With 45 days until Election Day, SEIU Local 1107 will kick off Saturday with a canvass launch at 10 a.m. where more than 200 SEIU members from Nevada and California will head out to knock on thousands of doors to elect pro-worker champions up and down the ballot.

“SEIU members are energized and all-in to elect candidates that deliver for Nevadans. We need leaders in office that stand with working people and will fight for racial and immigrant justice. There's too much at stake in this election, and together, we won't allow anti-worker and corporate interests to take us backward,” said Sam Shaw, Executive Director of SEIU Local 1107.

SEIU Local 1107 is running one of the most robust political programs throughout Nevada during 
the 2024 election. The program will include making over a million phone calls and door knocks 
to Nevada voters to deliver victories for pro-worker candidates and up and down the ballot. 
SEIU members from Nevada and California will be participating in massive weekly canvasses 
with over 200 members starting this Saturday. SEIU members across the country understand 
that electing Vice President Kamala Harris and Tim Walz, and re-electing Jacky Rosen to the 
US Senate, is the only way forward to deliver change for working families.  

Serving as a powerful rebuke to the alarming rise in hate crimes and divisive rhetoric in recent 
years, SEIU 1107 annually hosts the “Communities United Multicultural Festival” to 
celebrate diversity and the right to vote. The event is held as part of our union's ongoing 
commitment to diversity, civic engagement, voter participation and understanding across racial 
and identity lines. The festival has over 100 partners, vendors, and performers participating, 
including major unions, companies and grassroots organizations from the Asian American, 
Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander; Black; Latino; indigenous and LGBTQ+ communities.

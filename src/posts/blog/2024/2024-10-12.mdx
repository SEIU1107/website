On Saturday, October 12, 2024, SEIU Local 1107 proudly sponsored and attended the 96th Annual Freedom Fund Gala hosted by NAACP Branch 1111. Held at the iconic Caesars Palace in Las Vegas, this prestigious event brought together community leaders, union members, elected officials, and activists to celebrate the continued fight for civil rights and equality. With SEIU Local 1107 serving as a Bronze-level sponsor, our members had the honor celebrating  alongside some of Nevada's most influential leaders, including several SEIU-endorsed candidates, and participating in a night dedicated to justice, empowerment, and unity.

SEIU Local 1107 members were deeply engaged in the evening's festivities. From 6:00 PM to 10:00 PM, the gala offered an incredible blend of musical performances, inspiring speeches, and a shared commitment to advancing equality for all. Attendees were treated to soulful music that resonated with the themes of freedom and perseverance, setting the tone for a night of reflection and action.

One of the highlights of the evening was the opportunity for SEIU Local 1107 members to dine and engage with 1107 endorsed candidates and community champions. Among them were Shondra Summers-Armstrong, Danielle Morino, William McCurdy, and Tameka Henry & more. These individuals have long been advocates for working families, justice, and equalityâ€”values that align closely with the mission of SEIU Local 1107. Conversations centered around critical issues such as economic justice, healthcare access, and the importance of building stronger communities.

Shondra Summers-Armstrong, known for her dedication to working-class families, spoke with our members about the significance of union power in shaping policy and ensuring that all workers are treated with dignity and respect. Danielle Morino emphasized the importance of voter engagement and how union members can help drive political change in Nevada. William McCurdy and Tameka Henry also highlighted the power of collective action and the need for ongoing advocacy to ensure that working families continue to have a voice at the decision-making table.

The evening was made even more special by the presence of Tennessee State Representative Justin Jones, who served as the event's keynote speaker. Rep. Jones, known for his activism and commitment to social justice, delivered an impassioned speech on the importance of staying engaged in the fight for civil rights. He reminded the audience that while significant progress has been made, the work is far from over. His words resonated deeply with SEIU Local 1107 members, who have been at the forefront of fighting for workers' rights, racial justice, and economic equity in Nevada.

The 96th Annual Freedom Fund Gala was not only a celebration of the achievements of the NAACP but also a reminder of the ongoing struggles faced by marginalized communities. SEIU Local 1107 is proud to stand alongside the NAACP in its efforts to promote justice and equality, and our members left the event inspired to continue the fight for a fairer and more just society.

As we look ahead, SEIU Local 1107 remains committed to building strong alliances with community organizations like the NAACP and supporting leaders who share our vision of equality for all. We will continue to advocate for policies that uplift working families, protect workers' rights, and promote social justice in every corner of Nevada.

In solidarity, we are stronger, and events like the Freedom Fund Gala remind us of the power we have when we stand united. Together, we will keep fighting for the change our communities deserve.

On Wednesday, October 16th, SEIU Local 1107 proudly welcomed the Harris Campaign's reproductive justice bus to Nevada, part of a historic national tour that kicked off in Florida last month. Vice President Kamala Harris' campaign launched this powerful initiative—a weekslong, 50-stop "Reproductive Freedom Bus Tour" focused on amplifying the critical need for reproductive justice across battleground states.

The Nevada stop brought together a dynamic lineup of speakers, including Maya Harris, who delivered a keynote address, alongside prominent figures like actress and activist Elizabeth Banks, Nevada Senator Jackie Rosen, and Representative Susie Lee. Each speaker underscored the importance of safeguarding reproductive rights, particularly in the face of recent legislative challenges.

At the heart of the gathering was a shared sense of urgency surrounding the upcoming Nevada ballot measure, Yes on 6. This measure would enshrine the right to reproductive freedom in Nevada's constitution, ensuring that women and all Nevadans maintain the ability to make their own healthcare decisions.

Reproductive justice is about more than just access to healthcare—it's about equity, autonomy, and the right to live without the fear of discrimination in accessing essential services. The community's turnout for the bus tour emphasized how deeply these issues resonate with Nevadans.

With reproductive rights on the ballot, the event also served as a rallying cry to vote Yes on 6. This is more than a political issue; it's a movement to ensure that future generations can enjoy the freedoms we fight for today. Nevadans are ready to stand up, be heard, and protect the rights of everyone in the state.

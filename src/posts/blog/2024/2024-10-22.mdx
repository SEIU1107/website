This past weekend, SEIU Local 1107 welcomed nearly 600 union brothers and sisters from locals across the country, as well as our international leaders, for a monumental Cross Caucus Canvass event in Nevada.

This event wasn't just about gathering—it was a massive display of worker power and solidarity. Clad in matching purple "SEIU for Kamala Harris" shirts, we hit the streets and phone lines together with one goal: to Get Out the Vote (GOTV) for the upcoming election. This grassroots effort launched on the first day of early voting, and the numbers don't lie—over 30,000 Nevadans cast their ballots that day alone!

The significance of this election is clear. Working people know that their voices are on the line, and SEIU is committed to ensuring that those voices are heard. From knocking on doors to phone banking, we are ready, united, and determined to make sure every eligible voter has their say.

We were also honored to be joined by several Democratic candidates who lent their energy to this incredible effort. Representatives like Steven Horsford, William McCurdy, Shondra Summers-Armstrong, Dallas Harris, Danielle Monroe Moreno, and more stood alongside us in this fight, reinforcing just how critical this election is for working families.

With early voting running from October 21 to November 2, there's still time to make your voice count. If you haven't already, we strongly urge you to get out and vote today! Every vote matters, and together, we will make a difference.

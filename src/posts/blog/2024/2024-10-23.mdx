On the first day of early voting, SEIU Local 1107 proudly welcomed members from Locals 721, 521, 1021, 1000, and 2015 to Las Vegas, creating a massive sea of purple that showcased our solidarity and strength. Nearly 600 dedicated members gathered at a rally featuring SEIU-endorsed candidates, including Senator Jackie Rosen, Congressman Stephen Horsford, and Congresswoman Dina Titus, along with many more committed leaders. The energy in the air was electric!

As we celebrated this momentous day, it was inspiring to see over 30,000 Nevadans cast their votes, affirming the importance of participation in our democracy. The rally was a testament to our collective commitment to fighting for workers' rights and ensuring that our voices are heard at the ballot box.

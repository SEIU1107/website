On Saturday, October 26, SEIU Local 1107 hosted a powerful Racial Justice and Immigration Workshop at our Union Hall, creating a welcoming space for local residents to learn, connect, and get support. Organized by SEIU Local 1107's Latino, African American, Lavender, and Asian American Pacific Islander (AAPI) Caucuses, with help from dedicated community partners, the event provided free legal advice, answered questions on citizenship, and shared information on immigrant rights.

We were honored to have Senator Pat Spearman, Senator Mazie Hirono, and Commissioner Tick Segerblom join us in person. They each spoke to attendees, offering heartfelt support and sharing words of unity about the importance of immigration in America. Their presence underscored the collective commitment to justice and inclusivity, resonating deeply with everyone who attended.

The event wasn't just about information—it was also about bringing people together over good food and cultural pride. Attendees enjoyed a spread of dishes from different cultures, representing the rich diversity that makes our community so vibrant and unique. This cultural exchange helped create a strong sense of unity and warmth throughout the day.

SEIU Local 1107 is proud to stand with our community, and we thank everyone—especially our speakers, volunteers, and community partners—who helped make this day a success. We look forward to more events where we can continue to support each other and build a more inclusive Las Vegas.

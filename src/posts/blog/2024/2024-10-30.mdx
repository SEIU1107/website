Renowned civil rights leader Rev. Al Sharpton visited SEIU Local 1107 in Las Vegas on Wednesday to inspire communities to exercise their right to vote. As the founder of the National Action Network, Rev. Sharpton spent the day engaging with local leaders, activists, and politicians, emphasizing the vital role of civic engagement in shaping the future ahead of Election Day.

Sharpton's visit began at Wealthy Place Ministries in the Historic Westside, where he joined religious leaders to discuss mobilizing their congregations. He encouraged attendees to take their voices to the polls, delivering a poignant message about the significance of informed voting.

“I'm not here to tell you who to vote for, but to vote for who is in your best interest,” Sharpton said. “Clearly there are forces out there that want to rob our right to vote and want to bring us backwards in terms of equity and fairness.”

Sharpton then met with members of SEIU Local 1107, one of Nevada's largest unions representing healthcare and public sector workers. He spent time with President Michelle Maese and Executive Director Sam Shaw during a “Real Talk” discussion at the union's office. Together, they addressed critical issues impacting Nevada's working families and strategies to ensure strong voter turnout.

The day concluded with a networking event at Tap N Ash, a social club located in the Arts District. The event allowed community members to engage in meaningful conversations about the power of voting to drive equity and change.

With Election Day fast approaching, Sharpton's visit serves as a rallying call for Nevadans to make their voices heard. Early voting ends on Friday, Nov. 1, and Election Day is Tuesday, Nov. 5.

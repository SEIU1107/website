Our annual back-to-school event was a huge success! We distributed hundreds of school supplies to our members and their families. Thank you to everyone who joined us! And, congratulations to the 6 winners of our scholarships! Together, we continue to build power and solidarity in our community!

Unions aren't just about contracts — it's also about building strength in our communities. We're proud to support our members and their families as everyone prepares to go back to school! Thanks to Carpenters Local 1977 for hosting us!

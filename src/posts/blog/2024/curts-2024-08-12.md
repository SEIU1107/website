The 2024 Communities United Festival holds significance as Nevada is a crucial battleground state in the upcoming election. The event aims to mobilize voters - in particular union members, youth, and communities of color - through voter registration and education initiatives. Attendees will have the opportunity to engage with various organizations dedicated to encouraging unprecedented voter participation in this pivotal election.

"This festival is about more than just celebrating our diverse cultures; it's about harnessing our collective power to make a difference," said Michelle Maese, President of SEIU Local 1107. "Communities United aims to inspire and mobilize our community to take action. We anticipate our biggest turnout ever this year, as the enthusiasm and support from past years continue to grow. Don't miss your chance to be part of this year's festivities!"

The SEIU Local 1107 Lavender Caucus was proud to participate in the 2024 Las Vegas Pride Parade Night marching in celebration of love, equality, and the vibrant diversity within our community. 

The SEIU1107 Lavender Caucus members came together with a shared mission of promoting inclusivity and standing in solidarity with the LGBTQ+ community. In the weeks leading up to the event, members united to plan every detail of their participation. They organized a creative session where they worked together to design and decorate the SEIU float, which shimmered with vibrant colors and the powerful message of "Equality for All." Each member brought their own touch to the preparations, and the sense of camaraderie grew as they collaborated, eager to represent the union in this important community event.

As the night of the parade arrived, the excitement was electric. Decked out in their colorful attire—ranging from rainbow-themed outfits to creative expressions of individuality—the Lavender Caucus members and President, Deb Springer marched with pride. They distributed candy to parade attendees, delighting children and adults alike, sharing smiles, and creating memorable interactions with everyone they met. The joy on their faces and the warmth of the community's reception were a testament to the spirit of Las Vegas Pride.

What made the night even more special was the broad participation of local community partners, who also showed up to support the LGBTQ+ community. Major partners like Walmart, Aid for AIDS of Nevada (AFAN), Intermountain Health, T-Mobile, Bank of America, and many others were present, marching alongside the Lavender Caucus and other participants. It was incredible to see so many businesses and organizations come together for a common cause, each float adding to the festive atmosphere and demonstrating a collective commitment to equality.

This year’s parade was more than just a celebration; it was a powerful reminder of the progress made and the work that remains ahead.

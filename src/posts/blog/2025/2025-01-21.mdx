On January 20, 2025, members of SEIU Local 1107 proudly marched in the annual Martin Luther King Jr. Parade, demonstrating their unwavering commitment to justice, equality, and workers' rights. This year's march held special significance as SEIU members stood in solidarity with Councilwoman Shondra Summers-Armstrong, a dedicated public servant and long-time advocate for working families in Nevada.

The parade, one of the largest MLK celebrations in the country, brought together thousands of union members, activists, and community leaders to honor Dr. King's legacy. SEIU members, clad in their signature purple, carried banners and signs championing economic and social justice, chanting in unison to reaffirm their fight for better wages, healthcare, and workplace protections.

Councilwoman Summers-Armstrong has been a steadfast ally of Nevada's labor movement, advocating for policies that uplift working people and ensure their voices are heard at every level of government. Her leadership in addressing affordable housing, fair wages, and public services has made a tangible difference in the lives of countless families across Las Vegas.

“Dr. King's vision was about economic justice as much as it was about civil rights,” said Michelle Maese, President of SEIU Local 1107. “Councilwoman Summers-Armstrong embodies that vision, and we are proud to march in solidarity with her today.”

The event was not only a celebration of Dr. King's life and work but also a call to action for SEIU members to continue organizing and advocating for policies that benefit all working Nevadans. As chants of “When We Fight, We Win!” echoed through the streets, the presence of SEIU Local 1107 served as a powerful reminder that the fight for justice is far from over.

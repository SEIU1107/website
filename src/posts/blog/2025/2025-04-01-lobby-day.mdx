On March 25, over **100 dedicated members** from SEIU Local 1107 made the journey to Carson City for our annual **Lobby Day** at the **83rd Legislative Session**. Representing a broad spectrum of professions within our local, we united to urge Nevada lawmakers to support our **CARE Agenda**—a comprehensive plan designed to uplift children, workers, and communities across the state. 

The **CARE Agenda** stands for **Children's Safety**, **Advancing Workers' Rights**, **Require Safe Working Conditions & Ending** poverty wages. It's a call to action for lawmakers to prioritize the well-being of Nevada's children, families, and workers, while also addressing issues that have long been neglected. This year, we brought our collective voices together to ensure that our vision for a stronger, more equitable state becomes a reality. 

One of the cornerstones of our **CARE Agenda** is ensuring Nevada's children have access to the mental health resources, quality education, and safe, supportive environments they deserve. We are demanding updates to state laws to guarantee that children in Nevada are no longer overlooked when it comes to the essential services they need to thrive. 

Our agenda also calls for critical community investments—increasing funding and staffing for public health, affordable housing, and county services. These resources are essential for the prosperity and safety of families across Nevada. It's time to ensure that community-based services are fully supported and staffed, so that families can access the care they need to stay healthy and secure. 

The **CARE Agenda** also includes a powerful commitment to advancing workers' rights. We are pushing for stronger protections that make it easier for workers to join a union and fight for better wages, benefits, and working conditions. Every worker deserves the opportunity to be part of a union that will fight for fair treatment, safe working conditions, and fair pay. 

Furthermore, we are calling for safe working conditions for all workers, from healthcare professionals to educators and beyond. Understaffing and over-assigned workloads pose real threats to the safety and well-being of patients, children, and community safety. It's critical that we pass legislation that ensures all workers can perform their jobs in safe and fair environments, without fear of injury, exhaustion, or exploitation. 

Another major part of the **CARE Agenda** is the urgent need to **end poverty wages**. For too long, hardworking Nevadans, particularly those in home care and other essential services, have been underpaid for the crucial work they do. Our members are fighting to **raise Nevada's minimum wage** for home care workers to **$20 an hour**—a necessary step to ensure these workers are paid fairly for their vital contributions to the community. 

On Lobby Day, our members met directly with Nevada lawmakers to advocate for these crucial issues. Whether it was through one-on-one meetings or testifying in legislative hearings, our members made it clear: We are demanding change, and we won't stop until our communities and workers get the support they need. 

<h2 class="text-center">What's Next?</h2>

While we're proud of the progress made during Lobby Day, our work is far from over. As the 83rd Legislative Session continues, SEIU Local 1107 will keep pushing for the **CARE Agenda** bills to become law. We will continue to advocate for fair wages, safe working conditions, and the resources needed to support Nevada's children and families. 

We encourage all our members to stay engaged, stay informed, and continue fighting for the changes we need. Together, we have the power to build a better, fairer Nevada for all. 

Thank you to the over **100 SEIU Local 1107 members** who traveled to Carson City and made their voices heard. Your dedication is what fuels our movement. Let's keep pushing for the change that Nevada's workers, children, and families deserve.

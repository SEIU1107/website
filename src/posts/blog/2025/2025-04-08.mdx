We're thrilled to reflect on the success of the SEIU Local 1107 Know Your Rights Workshop, which took place over two impactful daysâ€”March 26 and March 29. Organized by the Racial Justice Committee in collaboration with the AFRAM, API, Latino, and Lavender Caucuses, this event provided essential resources and vital information to our community, empowering attendees to better understand their rights and navigate legal challenges. 

The first day of the workshop was filled with informative presentations, important conversations, and a sense of unity as attendees gathered to learn about their rights in various areas, from immigration law to civil rights protections. We heard from incredible speakers who shared valuable insights into the resources and legal support available to those who need it most.

The second day brought even more energy and engagement, with an impressive turnout and powerful discussions that built upon the foundation laid on day one. Panelists and community leaders gathered to provide additional support, answering questions and addressing concerns that directly impact our diverse communities.

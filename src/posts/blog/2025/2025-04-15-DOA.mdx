SEIU Local 1107 Executive Vice President of the Public Sector, **Richard Hodgson**, recently **secured thousands of dollars in backpay** for workers at the Nevada Department of Aviation after uncovering an issue with **shift differential** compensation. The issue began when a member reached out to Hodgson asking about how shift differential works for swing and graveyard shifts. Hodgson quickly realized that many employees in the **Airport Control Center** were not receiving the additional 4% pay for qualifying shifts. 

After confirming the problem, Hodgson contacted the **Employee Services Director** and raised concerns about multiple workers being denied compensation. Following an investigation, the management team agreed to apply an **18-month lookback period** to compensate affected workers. As a result, around **30 employees** received the backpay they were owed. One employee received **$5,000** for an **18-month period**.

The issue stemmed from a misunderstanding of the shift differential rules, which was corrected by retraining the timekeeper. This victory showcases **Richard Hodgson's dedication** to advocating for workers and ensuring fair compensation. 

With the situation resolved, **Nevada Department of Aviation** employees are now properly compensated, and SEIU Local 1107 remains committed to protecting workers' rights and ensuring fairness in the workplace.

I recently helped secure thousands of dollars in backpay for workers at the Nevada Department of Aviation after uncovering an issue with shift differential compensation. It all started when a member reached out to me with a question about how shift differential works for swing and graveyard shifts. As I looked into it, I realized that many employees in the Airport Control Center weren't receiving the additional 4% pay they were entitled to for qualifying shifts.

After confirming the issue, I contacted the Employee Services Director to raise concerns about multiple workers being denied proper compensation. Management launched an investigation and ultimately agreed to apply an 18-month lookback period to correct the problem. Thanks to that decision, around 30 employees received the backpay they were owed—one of them even received $5,000 for that 18-month period. 

The problem came down to a misunderstanding of the shift differential rules, which was addressed by retraining the timekeeper. This outcome is a clear example of my commitment to standing up for workers and making sure they’re fairly paid for the work they do. 

Now that the issue has been resolved, employees at the Nevada Department of Aviation are being properly compensated, and SEIU Local 1107 remains strong in our mission to protect workers’ rights and promote fairness on the job.

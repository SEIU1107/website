Stephanie Hughes, president of SEIU Local 1107 AFRAM, was elected as the Western Regional Executive Vice President of AFRAM during the proceedings. Her election marks a significant leadership milestone for the local and further amplifies the role of Black union members in shaping national labor policy.

“This isn't just about representation—it's about leadership,” Hughes said. “We're building real power, from our union halls to the Capitol.” 

In the weeks ahead, the caucus plans to connect the momentum from Chicago to its efforts on the ground in Nevada, especially around Senate Bills 182, 183 and 306.

* [SB182](https://www.leg.state.nv.us/App/NELIS/REL/83rd2025/Bill/12200/Text) aims to strengthen protections for workers against retaliation.
* [SB183](https://www.leg.state.nv.us/App/NELIS/REL/83rd2025/Bill/12201/Text) seeks to improve wage transparency and promote equity.
* [SB306](https://www.leg.state.nv.us/App/NELIS/REL/83rd2025/Bill/12528/Text) focuses on expanding access to affordable healthcare statewide.

“These aren't just bills—they're protections for our communities,” Hughes said. “We're carrying the voices we heard in Chicago back home to make sure our legislators are listening. " It's time to organize, mobilize, and keep fighting. From Chicago to Nevada, we're building a movement that cannot be ignored.

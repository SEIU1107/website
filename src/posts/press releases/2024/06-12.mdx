The below statement was issued on behalf of Michelle Maese, President of SEIU 1107, and Sam Shaw, Executive Director of SEIU 1107:

The June 11 primary election was filled with victories by pro-worker candidates up and down the ballot. We are committed to ensuring that our endorsed candidates win in the primary and general election to secure a better future for working families in our communities.

So much is at stake for working families that we must have elected leaders who are ready to meet the moment. Workers are struggling. The cost for food, gas and housing are out of control and fundamental challenges remain to address racial and economic inequalities in our communities.

We expect elected officials to lead in the fight for good jobs that lift workers out of poverty and support our multi-racial and multi-generational movement that is dedicated to winning transformational change across all industries for all working people.

We're so pleased that the candidates who have joined us in the fight to improve health care, protect essential public services and secure greater racial and economic justice scored big victories last night.

We particularly want to congratulate state senators Rochelle Nguyen and Dina Neal, who recently helped lead the way for our historic legislative victory for home care workers and their clients. As a result of their work and the perseverance of the home care community, we were able to increase the minimum wage for home care workers to $16 an hour this year, and we look forward to continue working with Senators Nguyen and Neal to pass our “Silver State Home Care Standards,” which include a $20 minimum wage for caregivers, increased funding, expanded service hours for clients, professional training and reduced red tape.

We also want to congratulate retired SEIU 1107 member and current AD-6 Assemblymember Shondra Summers-Armstrong who secured the most votes in the primary and will move on in the November general election for the Las Vegas City Council, Ward 5 race.

We further want to recognize retired SEIU 1107 member and current AD-17 Assemblymember Claire Thomas for running a strong campaign for Senate District 1. Assemblywoman Thomas was the primary sponsor for Juneteenth and was one of only six legislators in 2023 with a 100% labor voting record. We are proud of her dedication to lifting up working families.

In total, 84% of SEIU 1107's primary endorsed candidates won outright and some will move on to a runoff in the November general election, which includes several critically important education races such as Aaron Bautista in a Nevada Board of Regents race and Eileen Eady, Tameka Henry and Kamilah Bywaters in their respective races for the Clark County School Board of Trustees. Our union is fully committed to protecting our children and ensuring that kids in all communities receive a quality education.

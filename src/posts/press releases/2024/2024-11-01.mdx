With GOTV efforts likely to determine the election's outcome, SEIU nears 2 million door knocks and phone calls made to Nevada voters.

SEIU members have become a key political force in the state for Vice President Kamala Harris and pro-worker candidates up and down the ballot. The union’s political program could make a big difference in several close federal races and in the state legislature where the union is pushing hard to elect a super majority of pro-worker leaders.

SEIU Local 1107 Executive Director Sam Shaw said the union has been incredibly active in encouraging Nevadans to vote. In collaboration with local partners and community leaders, SEIU is on track to make nearly 2 million door knocks and phone calls to Nevada voters this election cycle, focusing on working-class neighborhoods and key demographics to ensure that every voice is heard.

“SEIU members know what's at stake,” said SEIU Local 1107 Executive Director Sam Shaw. “This election is about our lives and livelihoods, from wages to healthcare access. Our members will do everything to help our communities participate and make sure every vote counts.”

SEIU's GOTV program emphasizes the union's commitment to empowering voters, with multilingual efforts and voter education at the forefront. Volunteers are prepared to cover ground and provide resources in English, Spanish, Tagalog, and Chinese, ensuring every voter receives vital information on their rights and polling details.

“This election is going to be very close, and Nevada voters may very well determine the future of our country,” said Michelle Maese, president of SEIU Local 1107. “Every single vote counts and could make the difference. We’re going to do everything in our power to make sure that the voice of working families from every community is heard.”

By the Numbers:
 * Over 700 SEIU members have knocked on doors and made calls throughout Nevada since August.
 * This weekend, over 150 SEIU members will be deployed statewide. Volunteers will be reaching voters across Clark and Washoe counties with a strong presence in Clark.
 * In the last few days of the election, SEIU expects to make nearly 400,000 more door knocks and phone calls to turn out the vote here in Nevada.

As one of the most extensive independent expenditure efforts this election cycle, SEIU's GOTV strategy prioritizes engagement with voters of color under 45—a crucial demographic in determining electoral outcomes across Nevada.

As Election Day approaches, SEIU and its partners are steadfast in driving voter turnout, ensuring that working families have their voices represented on the issues that matter most: fair wages, access to healthcare, and stronger worker protections.
